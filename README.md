This repository demonstrates a common misunderstanding in Rust's borrowing system. The example showcases multiple mutable references to the same variable, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior depending on the context. This is not necessarily a bug in the code itself, but rather a subtle nuance of Rust's ownership model that's important to grasp for avoiding potential concurrency issues.
